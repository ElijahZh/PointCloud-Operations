This project is majorly based on the functions and design ideas from Pointcept, with:

- A subset of their point cloud operation utilities

- Some extra methods specific to this project

- Added visualization and documentation for easier review

If you’re interested in a more complete and large-scale point cloud framework, please check out the original [Pointcept](https://github.com/Pointcept/Pointcept) repository.
